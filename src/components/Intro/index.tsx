              Growing up in Vietnam, I strongly believe that computer have had
              a profound impact on modern human history. Computers make life
              easier for human being in various ways. I want to create my own
              webs and apps. Wherefore this shot in my life, I am interested in
              Front-end Web Developer.

              Mathematics and Programming skills. I am fulfilling and satisfying
              after solving a question. I enjoy the process of looking for
              programming as perfect executions and done a Maths problem. Become
              a Front-end lover, I know that I should devote myself
              wholeheartedly to learning Front-end framework likes React and Vue
              to get into the Front-end’s world, so I have made a special effort
              to enhance my Front-end framework programming skills proficiency.

              responsibility and leadership. Apart with, it is a opportunities
              for me to work with my Council’s member and the others in
              organizing activities. It is also an occasion training my brain to
              think logically and effective. By the end of a year, I had already
              been amply rewarded for this success. In my experience, have a
              excellent communication skills and logically thinking skills not
              only beneficial in the programming engineer’s world, it but also
              beneficial in our society.

              have to learn to put ourselves into others’ shoes and learn to
              make contribution to our society.
